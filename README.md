# TR_Trade_1

Motivations:
    
Look into some new features of OO with python

Evaluate IDEs (Change from RStudio, BBEdit, nano. Tested Sublime Text, VSCode)

To develop an accounting system to better understand investment performance with Trade Republic

To evaluate code generators (Some of the early ipynb files are generated with LLMs. Google Colab is good with code generation from prompts and whilst editing does some excellent suggestions)
